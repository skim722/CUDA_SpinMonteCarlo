Hello! Welcome to the awesome GPU version where the future is NOW!

To use, please make sure the path to 'nvcc' compiler is set correctly in 'Makefile'.
As it is now, the path is set so that it works on the M2090/M2070 nodes on the Jinx cluster.
You can grab such a node by running './iv'.

Then, compile by 'make'.

To run the executable, type './heisenberg_model inputs.csv'.

Inside 'inputs.csv', you can change the variables accordingly.

Happy simulating!
